</ol>

<div class="content">
	<p>Web hosting for cloud applications has become a very lucrative market and as such, has attracted the world's largest, most predatory, and greediest corporations. These companies are able to get away with unethical business practices, misleading billing, and substandard developer tools because they assume that they have a monopoly over the market and don't need to care about you, the potential customer.  There are many excellent and ethical companies offering superior web hosting services with better service at a lower cost.  So even aside from ethics, there's very little reason to engage the services of the unethical corporations listed below. </p>
